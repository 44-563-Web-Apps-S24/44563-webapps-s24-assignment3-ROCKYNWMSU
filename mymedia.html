     <p> My favourite song is Salaam Rocky Bhai, is from the Indian film KGF .The interesting fact about this song is it has an energitic Anthem for protogonist,Rocky. The song is a celebration of Rocky's rise in the criminal underworld and his powerful presence.The song is accompanied by powerful visuals that showcase Rocky's dominance and influence in the world he operates in. Overall, "Salaam Rocky Bhai" is not just a song in the movie; it has become a symbol of Rocky's character and has left a lasting impression on fans of the "KGF" franchise.</p>
